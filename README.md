# Movie Data Visualization Project

Analyze and visualize the relationship between movie ratings and runtimes using Python's data analysis libraries.

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of movies to understand patterns in movie runtimes and how they correlate with ratings. By using powerful Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project delves deep into the data, providing a visually appealing and informative representation of the underlying trends.

Setup & Installation
Clone this repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd your_repository_name
(Optional) Create a virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Run the main script to generate the scatter plot visualization.

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Check the generated plots in the output or display directory.

Key Insights
The peak of the distribution suggests a mode runtime of approximately 100 minutes for movies in the dataset.
There's a varied spread of runtimes across different ratings, indicating that a movie's length doesn't necessarily correlate with its rating.
